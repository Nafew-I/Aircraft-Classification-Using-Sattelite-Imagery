# Aircraft-Classification-Using-Sattelite-Imagery

The following is a machine learning project I did with a group of 4 people to classify aircraft from attelite imagery. It contains a baseline convolutional neural network model similar to LeNet-5 and a primary model similar to ResNet-18. This project was done for APS360 (Applied fundamentals of deep learning).
